# systemd-minecraftd

My configuration files for my systemd-enabled Minecraft server

___

I just followed [this guide](https://teilgedanken.de/Blog/post/setting-up-a-minecraft-server-using-systemd/).

While there are MANY guides on how to create good systemd units for managing your Minecraft server, most are kinda bad or out-dated or too-complicated for my use-case.

And for rcon, use this [rust client](https://github.com/klemens/rconc), rather than mcrcon. Nothing wrong with mcrcon, it's just that rconc has more features AND IT'S IN RUST!!!!!
